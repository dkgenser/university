# Lab 8: Assembler and Simulator

Course: 15-123 Effective Programming in C and UNIX | Fall 2010

From the assignment description:

> This assignment is designed to help build your understanding of simple processors and the fetch-decode-execute cycle as well as the role of assembly language in software development. It will also provide reinforcement in C Language Programming, especially in the use of the bit-wise operators and function pointers.

The code is raw, unedited from when I originally wrote it.
